## Production URLs

- Frontend: https://frontend-production-6eb2.up.railway.app
- Backend: https://backend-production-a1a3.up.railway.app
- Backend health: https://backend-production-a1a3.up.railway.app/api/
- Backend version: https://backend-production-a1a3.up.railway.app/api/version

## Git And Deploy State

- Current local app-code fix: `54fb527fb1fdb3eed0a676166d2ff7b85b38a206`
- Current local HEAD: pending duplicate-comment skip-reason visibility commit
- Current origin/master: `fd27b5e57d25b9071512e52ca58d296199c8af37`
- Current production build_sha: `fd27b5e57d25`
- Current working status: Flight Recorder admin tab confirmed Candidate 1 — operator was repeatedly commenting from the same external account on the same posts, so `_handle_new_comment` was early-returning via the dedupe / already-replied / pending-queue / dm-failed-permanent paths BEFORE `rule_loading_finished` fired. Those early-returns were silent (no flight-recorder event), so Stop Point fell back to the literal `rule_not_matched`. Visibility-only patch in progress: every silent dedupe early-return now records an `automation_skipped` event with its existing reason string (`already_replied_success`, `comment_already_pending_queue`, `comment_already_partial_success`, `comment_already_dm_failed`, `public_reply_required_recovery`, plus the generic catch-all). No automation execution change, no extra reply/DM, no dedupe weakening.

Update these values at the start and end of every agent session.

## Confirmed Working

- Backend `/api/` health returns `ok`.
- Backend `/api/version` reports the deployed build SHA.
- Frontend public SPA routes return 200.
- `/app/admin/instagram-diagnostics` is not exposed as a frontend diagnostics UI.
- Protected backend admin support endpoints return 403 unauthenticated.
- Full backend suite passed at commit `d30f04e`: 622 tests.
- Full frontend suite passed at commit `d30f04e`: 184 tests.
- Frontend production build passed at commit `d30f04e`.
- Local backend suite passed after the stop-point summary accuracy fix: 623 tests.
- Local backend suite passed after the legacy general any-post matching fix: 627 tests.

## Current Blockers

- Billing remains blocked.
- Auth recovery email delivery E2E remains a billing blocker until proven end to end.
- Instagram automation still requires live verification after every production deploy because Meta behavior cannot be fully proven by unit tests.
- Instagram comment automation is currently observed through polling in the operator stop-point page; instant webhook delivery still needs protected endpoint/log confirmation and may depend on Meta Advanced Access/subscription state.
- Legacy general/any-post rule matching fix still requires production deploy and live retest before it can be considered known-good.
- Railway always-on status must be confirmed before billing.

## Do-Not-Touch Constraints

- Do not start Billing.
- Do not weaken webhook HMAC verification.
- Do not remove dedupe.
- Do not remove rate limits or anti-spam send pacing.
- Do not reintroduce `/app/admin/instagram-diagnostics`.
- Do not log tokens, secrets, authorization headers, full webhook payloads, full DM bodies, or passwords.
- Do not remove legacy account fallback logic without a tested migration.
- Do not use `users.active_instagram_account_id` for webhook execution.
