## Project

Project name: MyChat

Stack:

- Backend: FastAPI, MongoDB
- Frontend: React, CRA, CRACO
- Hosting: Railway
- Integrations: Instagram Business Login, Instagram Graph API, webhooks, Sentry

## Production URLs

- Frontend: https://frontend-production-6eb2.up.railway.app
- Backend: https://backend-production-a1a3.up.railway.app
- Backend health: https://backend-production-a1a3.up.railway.app/api/
- Backend version: https://backend-production-a1a3.up.railway.app/api/version

## Git And Deploy State

- Current local app-code fix: pending `fix(instagram): scope dedupe per post and add automatic text fallback`
- Current local HEAD: `c1f1c086e043c75ccd2b2a64d4c0c10409008ff5` plus local working changes
- Current origin/master: `c1f1c086e043c75ccd2b2a64d4c0c10409008ff5`
- Current production build_sha: `c1f1c086e043`
- Current working status: Implementing account-agnostic Instagram automation reliability patch. Same-commenter different-post interactions should no longer be blocked by an older processed comment document from a different media/post; existing exact-comment and same-commenter/same-media/same-rule dedupe remain intact. Opening DMs that include Instagram quick replies now automatically append a browser/laptop typed fallback instruction derived from the same button title (Arabic or English), so creators do not need to edit old automation messages manually. Mobile quick replies remain unchanged; typed fallback still requires a pending comment-DM session. No Billing, HMAC, rate-limit, frontend diagnostics route, or username special-case change.

Update these values at the start and end of every agent session.

## Confirmed Working

- Backend `/api/` health returns `ok`.
- Backend `/api/version` reports the deployed build SHA.
- Frontend public SPA routes return 200.
- `/app/admin/instagram-diagnostics` is not exposed as a frontend diagnostics UI.
- Protected backend admin support endpoints return 403 unauthenticated.
- Full backend suite passed at commit `d30f04e`: 622 tests.
- Full frontend suite passed at commit `d30f04e`: 184 tests.
- Frontend production build passed at commit `d30f04e`.
- Local backend suite passed after the stop-point summary accuracy fix: 623 tests.
- Local backend suite passed after the legacy general any-post matching fix: 627 tests.
- Local multi-account automation routing suite passed after the dedupe-per-post and automatic text fallback patch: 131 tests.
- Local full backend suite passed after the dedupe-per-post and automatic text fallback patch: 674 tests.

## Current Blockers

- Billing remains blocked.
- Auth recovery email delivery E2E remains a billing blocker until proven end to end.
- Instagram automation still requires live verification after every production deploy because Meta behavior cannot be fully proven by unit tests.
- Instagram comment automation is currently observed through polling in the operator stop-point page; instant webhook delivery still needs protected endpoint/log confirmation and may depend on Meta Advanced Access/subscription state.
- Same-commenter different-post dedupe and automatic typed fallback require production deploy and live retest before being considered known-good.
- Railway always-on status must be confirmed before billing.

## Do-Not-Touch Constraints

- Do not start Billing.
- Do not weaken webhook HMAC verification.
- Do not remove dedupe.
- Do not remove rate limits or anti-spam send pacing.
- Do not reintroduce `/app/admin/instagram-diagnostics`.
- Do not log tokens, secrets, authorization headers, full webhook payloads, full DM bodies, or passwords.
- Do not remove legacy account fallback logic without a tested migration.
- Do not use `users.active_instagram_account_id` for webhook execution.
